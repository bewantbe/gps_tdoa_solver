	abstract = {The global positioning system (GPS) equations are usually solved with an application of Newton's method or a variant thereof: Xn+1 = xn + H-1(t - f(xn)). (1) Here x is a vector comprising the user position coordinates together with clock offset, t is a vector of tour pseudorange measurements, and H is a measurement matrix of partial derivatives H = fx{\textperiodcentered} In fact the first fix of a Kalman filter provides a solution of this type. If more than four pseudoranges are available for extended batch processing, H-1 may be replaced by a generalized inverse (HTWH)-1HTW, where W is a positive definite weighting matrix (usually taken to be the inverse of the measurement covariance matrix). This paper introduces a new method of solution that is algebraic and noniterative in nature, computationally efficient and numerically stable, admits extended batch processing, improves accuracy in bad geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) situations, and allows a "cold start" in deep space applications.},

	abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a satellite-based radio navigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Space Force. It is one of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) that provide geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. It does not require the user to transmit any data, and operates independently of any telephonic or Internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. It provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. Although the United States government created, controls and maintains the GPS system, it is freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.},
